    <h3>28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String</h3>
    <p> Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first
        occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of
        haystack.</p>

    <br />
    <strong>Example 1:</strong>
    <br />
    <strong>Input:</strong> haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
    <br />
    <strong>Output: </strong>0
    <br />
    <strong>Explanation: </strong>"sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
    The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
    <strong>Example 2:</strong>
    <br />
    <strong>Input: </strong>haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
    <br />
    <strong>Output: </strong>-1
    <strong>Explanation: </strong>"leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we
    return -1.

    <strong>Constraints:</strong><br />
    <p> 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
        haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.</p>
